  This will be eventually moved under .cask-market-place class
   Right now this changes globally and thats not how it should be.
   Have created a PR for reactstrap and got it merged(https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap/pull/111)
   Once the release is bumped to 2.6.1 or 2.7.0 will update reactstrap
   and will move the code appropriately to have style namespaced.
