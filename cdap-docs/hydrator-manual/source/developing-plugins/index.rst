This section is intended for developers writing custom plugins. Users of plugins and
pipelines should refer to the documentation on :ref:`using plugins
<cask-hydrator-introduction-what-is-a-plugin>`.

CDAP provides for the creation of custom plugins to extend the existing
``cdap-data-pipeline`` and ``cdap-data-streams`` system artifacts.

**Note:** *As of CDAP 3.5.0, the* ``cdap-etl-batch`` *artifact has been deprecated and replaced with the*
``cdap-data-pipeline``, *artifact, and the* ``cdap-etl-realtime`` *artifact has been deprecated and replaced with the*
``cdap-data-streams``, *artifact.*

Deploying plugins is covered under :ref:`Plugin Management: Plugin Deployment
<cask-hydrator-plugin-management-deployment>`, for deploying as either a system or user
artifact.
