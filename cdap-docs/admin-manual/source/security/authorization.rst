=============
Authorization
=============
Authorization allows users to enforce fine-grained access control on CDAP entities:
namespaces, artifacts, applications, programs, datasets, streams, and secure keys. All
operations on these entities |---| listing, viewing, creating, updating, managing,
deleting |---| are governed by authorization policies.

.. _security-enabling-authorization:

Enabling Authorization
======================
To enable authorization in :term:`Distributed CDAP <distributed cdap>`, add these
properties to :ref:`cdap-site.xml <appendix-cdap-default-security>`:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Value
   * - ``security.authorization.enabled``
     -  true
   * - ``security.authorization.extension.extension.jar.path``
     - Absolute path of the JAR file to be used as the authorization extension. This file
       must be present on the local file system of the CDAP Master. In an HA environment, it
       should be present on the local file system of all CDAP Master hosts.

Authorization in CDAP only takes effect once :ref:`perimeter security
<admin-perimeter-security>` is also enabled by setting ``security.enabled`` to ``true``.
Additionally, it is recommended that Kerberos be enabled on the cluster by setting
``kerberos.auth.enabled`` to ``true``.

These additional properties can also be optionally modified to configure authorization:

- ``security.authorization.admin.users``
- ``security.authorization.cache.enabled``
- ``security.authorization.cache.refresh.interval.secs``
- ``security.authorization.cache.ttl.secs``

Please refer to :ref:`cdap-defaults.xml <appendix-cdap-default-security>` for
documentation on these configuration settings.

Authorization in CDAP is implemented as :ref:`authorization extensions
<authorization-extensions>`. Apart from the above configuration settings, an extension may
require additional properties to be configured. Please see the documentation on
individual extensions for configuring properties specific to that extension:

- :ref:`Integrations: Apache Sentry <apache-sentry>`

:ref:`Security extension properties <appendix-cdap-default-security>`, which are specified
in ``cdap-site.xml``, begin with the prefix ``security.authorization.extension.config``.

.. _security-cdap-instance:

CDAP Instances
==============
The concept of a *CDAP Instance* has been introduced to support authorization policies in
CDAP. A *CDAP Instance* is uniquely identified by an *instance name*, specified by the
property ``instance.name`` in the :ref:`cdap-site.xml <appendix-cdap-site.xml>`. Certain
operations in CDAP (listed in the next section) require privileges on the CDAP instance
identified by this property. One purpose of introducing this concept is to support, in the
future, the notion of multiple CDAP instances on which authorization policies are enforced
using the same authorization backend.

.. _security-authorization-policies:

Authorization Policies
======================
Currently, CDAP allows users to enforce authorization for *READ*, *WRITE*, *ADMIN*, and
*EXECUTE* operations. (This list will be expanded to allow for additional distinctions and
be made finer-grained in the future.)

In general, this summarizes the authorization policies in CDAP:

- A **create** operation on an entity requires *WRITE* on the entity's parent. For
  example, creating a namespace requires *WRITE* on the CDAP instance. Deploying an
  application, artifact, or dataset, or creating a stream requires a *WRITE* on the
  namespace.
- A **read** operation (such as reading from a dataset or a stream) on an entity requires
  *READ* on the entity.
- A **write** operation (such as writing to a dataset or a stream) on an entity requires
  *WRITE* on the entity.
- An **admin** operation (such as setting properties) on an entity requires *ADMIN* on
  the entity.
- A **delete** operation on an entity requires *ADMIN* on the entity.
- A **list** operation (such as listing or searching applications, datasets, streams,
  artifacts) only returns those entities that the logged-in user has at least one (*READ*,
  *WRITE*, *ADMIN*, *EXECUTE*) privilege on.
- A **view** operation on an entity only succeeds if the user has at least one (*READ*,
  *WRITE*, *ADMIN*, *EXECUTE*) privilege on it.

Additionally:

- Upon successful creation of an entity, the logged-in user receives all privileges
  (*READ*, *WRITE*, *ADMIN*, and *EXECUTE*) on that entity.
- Upon successful deletion of an entity, all privileges on that entity for all users are revoked.

CDAP supports hierarchical authorization enforcement, which means that an operation that
requires a certain privilege on an entity is allowed if the user has the same privilege on
the entity's parent. For example, reading from a CDAP dataset will succeed even if the
user does not have specific *READ* privileges on the dataset, but instead has *READ*
privileges on the namespace in which the dataset exists.

.. _security-bootstrapping-authorization:

Bootstrapping Authorization
===========================

When CDAP is first started with authorization enabled, no users are granted privileges on
any CDAP entities. Without any privileges, it can be impossible to bootstrap CDAP (create
a new namespace or create entities in the *default* namespace) unless an
external interface (such as `Hue <http://gethue.com/>`__) is used for a supported
authorization extension (such as :ref:`Integrations: Apache Sentry <apache-sentry>`).

To make this bootstrap process easier, during startup the CDAP Master issues these grants to
select users:

- The user that runs the CDAP Master is granted *ADMIN* on the CDAP instance, so that the
  *default* namespace can be created by that user if it does not already exist.

- The user that runs the CDAP Master is granted *READ*, *WRITE*, *ADMIN*, and
  *EXECUTE* on the system namespace, so operations such as creation of system tables,
  deployment of system artifacts, and deployment of system dataset modules can be
  performed by that user.

- Additionally, a comma-separated list of users specified as the
  ``security.authorization.admin.users`` in ``cdap-site.xml`` is granted *ADMIN*
  privileges on the CDAP instance and the *default* namespace, so that they have the
  required privileges to create namespaces and grant other users access to the *default*
  namespace. It is recommended that this property be set to the list of users that will
  administer and manage the CDAP installation.
