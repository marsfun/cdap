================================
Installation using Apache Ambari
================================

.. include:: ../_includes/installation/installation-steps-images.txt
   
.. rubric:: Notes

- `Apache Ambari <https://ambari.apache.org/>`__ can only be used to add CDAP to an **existing**
  Hadoop cluster, one that already has the required services (Hadoop: HDFS, YARN, HBase,
  ZooKeeper, and |---| optionally |---| Hive and Spark) installed.
- Ambari is for setting up HDP (Hortonworks Data Platform) on bare clusters; it can't be 
  used for clusters with HDP already installed, where the original installation was
  **not** with Ambari.
- These features are **currently not included** in the CDAP Apache Ambari Service (though they may in the future):
  
  - The CDAP Apache Ambari Service is not integrated with the `CDAP Authentication Server <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-4110>`__;
  - CDAP component `high-availability <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-4107>`__  is not supported;

- A number of features are currently planned to be added, including:

  - `pre-defined alerts <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-4106>`__  for CDAP services ;
  - select `CDAP metrics <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-4108>`__; and
  - a full `smoke test of CDAP functionality <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-4105>`__ after installation.


Preparing the Cluster
=====================

.. Hadoop Configuration
.. --------------------
.. include:: ../_includes/installation/hadoop-configuration.txt
      
You can make these changes during the configuration of your cluster `using Ambari 
<http://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari-2.2.0.0/bk_Installing_HDP_AMB/content/_customize_services.html>`__.

.. HDFS Permissions
.. ----------------
.. include:: ../_includes/installation/hdfs-permissions.txt


Downloading and Distributing Packages
=====================================

Downloading CDAP Ambari Service
-------------------------------
To install CDAP on a cluster managed by Ambari, we have available packages for
RHEL-compatible and Ubuntu systems, which you can install onto your Ambari management server.
These packages add CDAP to the list of available services which Ambari can install. 

.. highlight:: console

To install the ``cdap-ambari-service`` package, first add the appropriate CDAP repository
to your system’s package manager by following the steps below. These steps will install a
Cask repository on your Ambari server.

The **repository version** (shown in the commands below as |literal-cdap-slash-short-version|) 
must match the **CDAP series** which you’d like installed on your cluster. To install the
**latest** version of the *CDAP 3.0 series,* you would install the *CDAP 3.0 repository.*
The default (in the commands below) is to use **cdap/3.3**, which has the widest
compatibility with the Ambari-supported Hadoop distributions.

Replace |---| in the commands that follow on this page |---| all references to |literal-cdap-slash-short-version|
with the CDAP Repository from the list below that you would like to use:

.. _ambari-compatibility-matrix:

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Supported Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) Distributions    |
+----------------+-----------------+-------------------------+
| CDAP Series    | CDAP Repository | Hadoop Distributions    |
+================+=================+=========================+
| CDAP 3.4.x     | ``cdap/3.4``    | HDP 2.0 through HDP 2.4 |
+----------------+-----------------+-------------------------+
| CDAP 3.3.x     | ``cdap/3.3``    | HDP 2.0 through HDP 2.3 |

Installing CDAP Ambari Service
------------------------------
Now, install the ``cdap-ambari-service`` package from the repo you specified above:

Installing the CDAP Service via YUM
...................................
::

  $ sudo yum install -y cdap-ambari-service
  $ sudo ambari-server restart

Installing the CDAP Service via APT
...................................
::

  $ sudo apt-get install -y cdap-ambari-service
  $ sudo ambari-server restart


Installing CDAP Services
========================

You can now install CDAP using the Ambari Service Wizard.

Start the Ambari Service Wizard
-------------------------------
1. In the Ambari UI (the Ambari Dashboard), start the **Add Service Wizard**.

      :align: center
      :class: bordered-image
 
      **Ambari Dashboard:** Starting the *Add Service* Wizard

 
#. Select CDAP from the list and click *Next*. If there are core dependencies which are not
   currently installed on the cluster, Ambari will prompt you to install them.
 
   .. figure:: ../_images/ambari/ss02-select-cdap.png
      :figwidth: 100%
      :width: 800px
      :align: center
      :class: bordered-image
 
      **Ambari Dashboard:** Selecting *CDAP*
 
Assign CDAP Services to Hosts
-----------------------------

3. Next, assign CDAP services to hosts.

   CDAP consists of 4 daemons:
 
   #. **Master:** Coordinator service which launches CDAP system services into YARN
   #. **Router:** Serves HTTP endpoints for CDAP applications and REST API
   #. **Kafka Server:** For transporting CDAP metrics and CDAP system service log data
   #. **UI:** Web interface to CDAP and :ref:`Cask Hydrator <cask-hydrator>`
      (for CDAP 3.2.x and later installations)
 
   .. figure:: ../_images/ambari/ss03-assign-masters.png
      :figwidth: 100%
      :width: 800px
      :align: center
      :class: bordered-image-top-margin
 
      **Ambari Dashboard:** Assigning Masters
 
   We recommended you install all CDAP services onto an edge node (or the *NameNode*, for
   smaller clusters) such as in our example above. After assigning the master hosts, click
   *Next*.

#. Select hosts for the CDAP CLI client. This should be installed on every edge node on
   the cluster or, for smaller clusters, on the same node as the CDAP services.

   .. figure:: ../_images/ambari/ss04-choose-clients.png
      :figwidth: 100%
      :width: 800px
      :align: center
      :class: bordered-image
 
      **Ambari Dashboard:** Selecting hosts for *CDAP*
 
#. Click *Next* to customize the CDAP installation.

Customize CDAP
--------------

6. On the **Customize Services** screen, click the *Advanced* tab to bring up the CDAP configuration.
   Under *Advanced cdap-env*, you can configure environment settings such as heap sizes
   and the directories used to store logs and pids for the CDAP services which run on the edge nodes.

   **Including Spark:** If you are including Spark, the *Advanced cdap-env* needs to
   contain the location of the Spark libraries, typically as
   ``SPARK_HOME=/usr/hdp/<version>/spark``, where "<version>" matches the HDP version
   of the cluster, including its build iteration, such as "2.3.4.0-3485".

   .. figure:: ../_images/ambari/ss05-config-cdap-env.png
      :figwidth: 100%
      :width: 800px
      :align: center
      :class: bordered-image
 
      **Ambari Dashboard:** Customizing Services 1

#. Under *Advanced cdap-site*, you can configure all options for the operation and running
   of CDAP and CDAP applications.

   .. figure:: ../_images/ambari/ss06-config-cdap-site.png
      :figwidth: 100%
      :width: 800px
      :align: center
      :class: bordered-image
 
      **Ambari Dashboard:** Customizing Services 2

#. To use the CDAP Explore service (to use SQL to query CDAP data), you must have Hive
   installed on the cluster, have the Hive client libraries installed on the same host as
   the CDAP services, and have the *Advanced cdap-site* ``explore.enabled`` option set to
   *true* (the default). If you do not have Hive installed or available, this option must be
   set to *false*.

   **Router Bind Port, Router Server Port:** These two ports should match; *Router Server
   Port* is used by the CDAP UI to connect to the CDAP Router service.

   .. figure:: ../_images/ambari/ss07-config-enable-explore.png
      :figwidth: 100%
      :width: 800px
      :align: center
      :class: bordered-image
 
      **Ambari Dashboard:** Enabling *CDAP Explore*

   **Additional CDAP configuration properties**, not shown in the web interface, can be
   added using Ambari's advanced custom properties at the end of the page. Documentation
   of the available CDAP properties is in the :ref:`appendix-cdap-site.xml`.

   For a **complete explanation of these options,** refer to the :ref:`CDAP documentation
   of cdap-site.xml <appendix-cdap-site.xml>`. 
   
   **Additional environment variables** can be set, as required, using Ambari's 
   "Configs > Advanced > Advanced cdap-env".
